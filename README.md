# Programmer Per: Angular 2 

This is a project for presenting me, "[Per the Programmer](http://www.programmerper.com)".

The application is built with __Angular 2__, __TypeScript__, __SASS__ and tested with __Jasmine__ & __Protractor__ 
in a behaviour-driven manner. It also has a bit of __Gulp__ but is configured mainly with __npm__.
 _More to come ..._

I believe in the future of Semantic Web Components, modular and testable. My intention is to build this app in 
such a manner.

## Get Started
1. `git clone https://github.com/perjo927/angular2-preybird.git`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. You browser should open. If not,go to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Run tests / TDD

### Unit tests

1. `npm test`
2. Your browser should open. If it doesn't, go to: [http://127.0.0.1:8080/unit-tests.html](http://127.0.0.1:8080/unit-tests.html)
3. For test-driven development, keep the browser tab open while developing, and the tests will live-reload. 
You can run  `npm start` & `npm test` simultaneously, since the development and test servers run on different ports, and the development
server will also live-reload.

### End-to-end tests
1. `npm run e2e-test`

## CI
_Coming soon_
