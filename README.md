# Angular 2: Programmer Per 

This is a project for presenting me, "[Per the Programmer](http://www.programmerper.com)".

The application is built with __Angular 2__ and __TypeScript__. _More to come ..._

I believe in the future of Semantic Web Components, modular and testable. My intention is to build this app in 
such a manner.

## Get Started
1. `git clone https://github.com/perjo927/angular2-preybird.git`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

## CI
